    b. `display: flex` - mainly used on the parent element to show the element as flexbox

    c. `flex: value` - can be used on the child elements to give them weightage in the flexbox. Used for the second grid layour using flexbox challenge today.
    
    d. `flex-direction: row/column/row reverse/column reverse` - Can be used to define flexbox direction

    e. `justify-content: center` can be used to align children of the flexbox element horizontally center

Example: `grid-row: 1/3` will make the element start at row line 1 (so at the start of the grid) and end at row line 3 (at the beginning of the 3rd row) `grid-row: span 2` will make the element span for 2 rows
